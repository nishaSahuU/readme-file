# First Contributions

This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.


<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone https://github.com/projects4321/repo_name.git
```

where https://github.com/projects4321/repo_name.git is the url to this repository

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd first-contributions
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git switch -c add-alonzo-church
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes


<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add your-name to Contributors list"
```

replacing `your-name` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.


## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.
